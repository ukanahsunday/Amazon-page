          Long gone are the good old days when a cat<sup>’</sup>s biggest
          worries were mean dogs or a bath. Modern cats must confront satanists,
          online predators, the possibility of needing to survive in a
          post-apocalyptic wasteland, and countless other threats to their nine
          lives.

          For over four decades, the American Association of Patriots have stood
          at the vanguard of our country's defense by helping to prepare our
          nation's cat owners for the difficult conversations they dread having
          with their pets.
